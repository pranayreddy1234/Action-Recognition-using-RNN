# Action-Recognition-using-RNN
Research in human action recognition has accelerated significantly since the introduction of
powerful machine learning tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However,
effective and efficient methods for incorporation of temporal information into CNNs are still being
actively explored in the recent literature. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term
memory (LSTM) have achieved great success in processing sequential multimedia data and
yielded the state-of-the-art results in speech recognition, digital signal processing, video
processing, and text data analysis. In this project, we propose a novel action recognition method by
processing the video data using convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM network.
